    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cut the carrots, mushrooms and onion into small pieces and first fry the onion cubes in a pan until they are translucent. Then add the rest of the vegetables and fry briefly. Add the milk and heat the creamed spinach in it until the leaves are no longer frozen and the cream sauce has thickened slightly. Now add the cream cheese as well as the vegetable broth powder and mix well. Simmer for five minutes until the sauce has thickened nicely. Finally, squeeze a clove of garlic and season with salt, pepper and chili. The spinach mixture may be well spicy, since the spinach "swallows" relatively much salt during baking.</p>
    <p>In a separate saucepan, heat the butter until it has completely melted. Add the flour, stirring until smooth. Now, while stirring constantly, add the strained tomatoes, then pour in the cream directly and bring everything to the boil briefly. Add a clove of garlic and season with salt and pepper. Again, do not skimp on the salt.</p>
    <p>Cover the bottom of a baking dish with a thin layer of the tomato sauce and spinach, then alternate layers of lasagna, spinach and tomato sauce. Finish with the sauce and sprinkle with grated cheese without any gaps.</p>
    <p>Bake in a hot oven at 180 Â°C convection oven for about 30 minutes. After baking, let it stand in the turned-off oven for another five to ten minutes, then the lasagna will keep its shape perfectly and won't melt.</p>
    <p>Tip: It is also very tasty to place finely chopped slices of feta on top of one layer before adding the next layer of lasagna sheets.</p>
